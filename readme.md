There are a total of 6 html files that makeup verison 1.5 of the Wikipedia home.html like the name suggest is the home page and is where you shoudl start from. My code is written in a way that requires that each file needs to know the exact file locations for the links to work from page to page youll need to open them manually or change their link code to were ever they are stored in your computer.

To edit any of the files locations simply replace what is there with the current path of the downloaded files.
